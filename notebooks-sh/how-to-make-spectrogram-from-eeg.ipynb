The EEGs are waveforms and the Spectrograms are images. There is a discussion about this notebook [here][1].\n","\n","In version 1-3, we also train a simple model using our EEG spectrograms to confirm that they work well. We observe that a model trained with EEG spectrograms performs better than baseline models using only train means.\n","\n","# Exciting UPDATE!\n","Version 4 of this notebook uses a different formula to make spectrograms than earlier versions. I trained an EfficientNet model using the old version eeg spectrograms, new version spectrograms, and Kaggle spectrograms.

The Bipolar Double Banana Montage\n","In the Kaggle discussion [here][1], we learn what information we need to make spectrograms from eegs. The following website [here][2] is helpful also. To build 1 spectrogram, we need 1 time series signal. Kaggle provides us with 19 eeg time signals, so we must combine them into 4 time signals to make 4 spectrograms.\n","\n","In the diagram below, we see which electrode signals are needed to make the `LL, LP, RP, RR` spectrograms. Furthermore Kaggle discussions imply that most likely we create differences between consecutive electrodes and average the differences. For example, we create `LL spectrogram` with the formula: \n","\n","    LL = ( (Fp1 - F7) + (F7 - T3) + (T3 - T5) + (T5 - O1) )/4.\n","    \n","I am not positive that this is the correct formula. I also tried the formula below but it produced a worse CV score than the above formula, so perhaps the above is correct. I am confident that we only use these 5 electrodes to create `LL spectrogram`. I'm just a little unsure about the formula:\n","\n","    LL = ( Fp1 + F7 + T3 + T5 + O1 )/5.\n","    \n","# Exciting UPDATE!\n","I believe the above two formulas are wrong. Many Kagglers have pointed out that the above formula reduces to `LL = ( Fp1 - O1 )/4` which means that it does not use all the EEG signals. The new formula below utilizes all the EEG signals and produces EEG spectrograms that achieve better CV score and LB score than the Kaggle spectrograms. Therefore I think the following formula is the correct one:\n","\n","    LL Spec = ( spec(Fp1 - F7) + spec(F7 - T3) + spec(T3 - T5) + spec(T5 - O1) )/4.\n","    \n","Since creating a spectrogram is a non-linear operation, the above formula which computes 4 spectrograms and then takes the average is different than the formula below which computes 1 spectrogam. And the above formula does utilize all EEG signals and cannot be reduced to a shorter formula (like the one below).\n","\n","    LL Spec = spec( ( (Fp1 - F7) + (F7 - T3) + (T3 - T5) + (T5 - O1) )/4. )\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdeotte/Kaggle_Images/main/Jan-2024/montage.png)\n","\n","[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification/discussion/467877\n","[2]: https://www.learningeeg.com/montages-and-technical-components"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-05T17:23:22.73382Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-05T17:23:22.73319Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-05T17:23:22.742733Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-05T17:23:22.741046Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-05T17:23:22.733769Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.017131,"end_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:42.644893","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:42.627762","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["NAMES = ['LL','LP','RP','RR']\n","\n","FEATS = [['Fp1','F7','T3','T5','O1'],\n","         ['Fp1','F3','C3','P3','O1'],\n","         ['Fp2','F8','T4','T6','O2'],\n","         ['Fp2','F4','C4','P4','O2']]\n","\n","directory_path = 'EEG_Spectrograms/'\n","if not os.path.exists(directory_path):\n","    os.makedirs(directory_path)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006935,"end_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:42.659252","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-01-16T12:12:42.652317","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Optional Signal Denoising with Wavelet transform\n","We can optionally denoise the signal before creating the spectrogram.
